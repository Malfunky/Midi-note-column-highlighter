#This is a feature I wish the Reaper development team will add in the future.
The option to highlight the notecolumn and maybe also the noterow?
Many users are constantly duped by the visible gridlines not reflecting the grid settings...
Highlighing the note column might solve that issue for some.
This script is very limited to a couple of settings, and serves best as a demonstration.
"Notesize" has to be set to grid.
And it only highlights when grid settings are set to 1/4 , 1/8 , 1/16 and so on...
