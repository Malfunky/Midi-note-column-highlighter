#This script highlights your current grid settings in the midi editor. 
It follows the mouse around. 
This is handy when you adjust gridsize by hotkeys, like doubling it , or half it.
I wrote this script because it solves the "invisible gridline" issue. At least for me.
Reapers grid line spacing is erratic, and plays a ruse on my eyes. Specially after zooming.
But a script will never be as smooth and stable as a native function. 
There might be unforseen problems, that I might not be able to solve, or be bothered with.
Some of the functions in this code is not 100% reliable. 
Extremely large pointless triplet settings will give wrong highlighting.
