#This script best serves demonstration purposes. This is a feature I wish the Reaper development team will add in the future.
The option to highlight the notecolumn and maybe also the noterow?
Many users are constantly duped by the visible gridlines not reflecting the grid settings...
Highlighing the note column might solve that issue for some.
This script now works with most settings ,except "dotted". 
All though the script should work on larger grid sizes , its true benefit is highlighting the smaller notesizes that is not supported by visible grid lines
